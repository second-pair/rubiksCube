#  Rubik's Cube
This is intended to be a Rubik's Cube solver, but may end up being other things.
This is mainly a challenge project.

__NOTE:__  On a DPI-scaled Windows, DPI scaling has to be overridden in python.exe's Windows "properties".

##  Dependencies
- [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Version 3
- [`pyglet`](https://pypi.org/project/pyglet/#files) (pip-able)

I think that's it?
